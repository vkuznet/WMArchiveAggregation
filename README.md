# WMArchive Aggregation Project

This project is part of the [WMArchive](https://github.com/dmwm/WMArchive) project that stores the CMS workflow and data management _framework job reports (FWJRs)_.

An aggregation pipeline regularly processes the database of FWJRs to collect performance metrics. The web app visualizes the aggregated data and provides flexible filters and options to assist the CMS data operators in assessing the performance of the CMS computing jobs.
