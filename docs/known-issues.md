# Known Issues

- When selecting a scope filter suggestion from the dropdown, the input textfield shows `[object Object]` until it is updated with the fetched data:

  This does not occur when the suggestions are just text values instead of the value/description objects used to display exit code descriptions along the scope filter values.
- Overlong labels overlap each other in pie charts.
