# Report 011 - September 16, 2016

## Loading metrics dynamically

- The set of metrics to present in the UI is now specified in a JSON file that currently sits in `WMArchive/src/maps/metrics.json`. **The environment variable `WMARCHIVE_PERF_METRICS` must be set to point to this file**, since no metrics are hard-coded anymore. The JSON file contains a nested list of metrics along with their properties:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "key": "jobstate",
      "title": "Job State",
      "description": "Number of jobs and their success rate.",
      "unit": ""
    },
    {
      "key": "cpu",
      "title": "CPU",
      "metrics": [
        {
          "key": "TotalJobTime",
          "title": "Total Job Time",
          "description": "Job wall time.",
          "unit": "s"
        },
        // ...
      ]
    },
    // ...
  ]
  ```
- This file is read by the server and passed to the UI, that in turn presents these metrics to the user.
- The UI uses the `unit` specified for each metric to decide on a formatting style for its values. All formatting is done in `WMArchive/src/js/utils/format.js`.

## Reading MongoDB database from environment

- The MongoDB database and collection to use are now read from the environment variables `WMARCHIVE_PERF_DB` and `WMARCHIVE_PERF_COLL` and default to `aggregated.performance`.

## Project-wide documentation

- I wrote extensive documentation across the entire project to aid in the maintenance of the service.
- The [README.md](README.md) file gives an overview of the project and serves as an entry point to the documentation as well as an index to the weekly reports. It also lists [common tasks](README.md#common-tasks), [pending improvements](README.md#pending-improvements) and [known issues](README.md#known-issues).
- I wrote detailed documentation on various topics in the [docs](docs) directory.
- Finally I added a plethora of code-level comments and explanations as well as links to the documentation.

## Preparations for the presentation

- I prepared a number of slides for the [final presentation](presentation.pdf) of the project to present the service to the CMS community.
