## Aggregation over all available performance metrics

- All performance metrics available in FWJRs are now dynamically aggregated and can be retrieved from the server. These include:

  ```
  {
      "count": Integer,
      "events" : Integer,
      "performance" : {
          "multicore" : {},
          "storage" : {
              "writeTotalMB" : Float(MB),
              "readTotalMB" : Float(MB),
              // ...
          },
          "cpu" : {
              "TotalJobTime" : Float(seconds),
              "TotalJobCPU" : Float,
              // ...
          },
          "memory" : {
              "PeakValueRss" : Float,
              // ...
          }
      }
  }
  ```
- For now only a subset of these metrics is accessible in the UI. The specific metrics to be displayed along with their display name and value formatting shall be discussed soon.
- So far for each of these metrics the aggregation procedure computes their average across the FWJRs along with the number of FWJRs aggregated over, since not every FWJR provides a value for every metric.


## Finalized Scope

- Added the `exitCode` scope filter in [Report 005](005_2016-08-05.md).
- This completes the preliminary final set of scope filters. Tests will now determine if this set of scope filters is sufficient to provide a useful service to CMS data operators.


## Dynamic visualization handling

- Rearchitected the performance data fetching in the web app to allow for a more responsive UX. Instead of a single API call to fetch the entire dataset whenever a scope, metric or axis selection changes, the web app now handles the visualizations separately.
- The list of visualizations is constructed dynamically from the user's selection of metrics and axes.
- Data for a visualization is fetched only on creation and on scope changes.
- Suggestions for scope filters are fetched separately.
- This allows the UI to reflect the user's choice of visualizations immediately, displaying a loading indicator whenever the data for a visualization is not yet available. It also reduces request payloads, resulting in faster page loads.


## Prototype deployment

- I fixed a number of issues and implemented improvements to finalize a first deployment of the WMArchive performance prototype to the CMS testbed:
